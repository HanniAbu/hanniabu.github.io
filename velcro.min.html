I mess around time to time creating tiny projects using Bootstrap for the interface and wanted an easier way to customize the components' HTML and classes instead of constantly referencing the Bootstrap documentation.<h5>Goal:</h5><p>Create a user-interface to customize the HTML of different Bootstrap components. Each component should have it's own option panel, a section that shows updated previews of the component, and the corresponding HTML or the updated component. The website should be 100% client side so I can use Github as a host. The interface should be simple, elegant, and easy to use for non-technical people.<h5>Design:</h5><p>The tools I used for this are Bootstrap(grid only) and jQuery. On the design side, I wanted to test my CSS abilities and create a material design feel from scratch, including a custom drawer panel menu. I also really wanted this to behave as a single page app with no reloads, but I didn't want to use a framework in order to challenge myself a bit. All my 'views' are present in index.html and I toggle the views using CSS(this was before I knew this was the wrong way to go about this). I have a different view for each component and each view is just the content area(everywhere except the drawer panel). All the site's functionality is event driven and uses local storage to maintain some state information such as the last view you were on. I chose to do this because there's some components are used more than others so I wanted that last view to be the one to load when coming back to the site. For changing the page views I used the menu link classes to get the ID of the corresponding view. Each component's settings were stored in a separate Javascript object. When updating component settings, I used the classes associated which each button to update the component's setting. Upon editing a component, the corresponding HTML and preview is updated. To make it easier to get ready-to-use code out of this, I included formatting into the generated HTML and created a 'copy' button that would allow you to easily copy the HTML content.<h5>Experience:</h5><p>This was my first time working with the webstorage API, which was really simple and convenient to work with. I was really proud of my ability to implement a material design theme, although I didn't reference any of the official standards. Creating the functionality for the interface was actually harder than I thought it would be, but I really enjoyed the challenge.<h5>Hindsight:</h5><p>A lot of the view functionality could be refactored. Also, like I stated before, handling the views with CSS wasn't the proper way to do things. Even though, the site behaves well on desktop, which is what it is designed to be used on, so I would probably continue to handle the views as is. If I continue to expand upon the site, this may cause it to slow down to the point where it's noticeable and I'd have to separate the views and inject the views using Javascript. If I was starting from scratch I'd also incorporate some OOP into creating and updating the components. I would also use data attributes to pass information rather than wrangling with the class names and ID's. If this was something I was getting paid to make, I'd also use a library such as Materialize to create the material design UI in order to save time and money. Overall though, I'm still proud of what I made with how little I knew at the time of making this and being able to figure out how to stretch my skills.</div></div></section><br><br><br>
