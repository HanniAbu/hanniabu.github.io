In aquaponics, there are various parameters that are important to the health of the plants and the fish. Solutions that currently exist are directed towards hydroponic farms, aren't easily extensible, and/or don't include data visualization.<h5>Goal:</h5><p>Create a system that will collect data, present it on a dashboard to view current and historical values, allow users to control farm operations, and automatically to adjust parameters that are out of range. The interface should be simple, elegant, and easy to use for non-technical people.<h5>Design:</h5><p>We collect data using sensors which are hooked up to a headless Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi was modified to boot from the micro SD card and then run the file system off a USB drive. I made this decision for a few reasons. If there is a power failure, the flash drive has less of a chance of being corrupted, larger capacity flash drives are cheaper than equal capacity micro SD cards, running rsync is safer with this setup(if I remember correctly), and it's easier to move the flash drive from computer to computer if anything needs to be done with it. After retrieving sensor readings, the raw data is saved to a file. This file is then sent by LAN through SSH file transfer to our local desktop. I chose not to send anything over wifi to make the system slightly more secure. Once the desktop receives the file, the raw data is added to one MySQL database and it is also processed to put in the proper format and make sure the data is valid. I chose not to process the data on the Raspberry Pi in order to keep it lightweight. All the data, raw and processed, is stored in MySQL with 3NF normalization, and is periodically backed up and put onto an external HHD. MySQL was chosen since all the data is time-series. This data is then presented on a dashboard. The backend was built using PHP while the front-end was built using Bootstrap and jQuery. The dashboard presents the various sensors' current readings as a value, historical readings in graph form using chart.js, and a control panel. The control panel has options that allow the user to turn on/off lights, pumps, feeders, dosers, heaters, and fans, which are actuated through the Raspberry Pi. Incoming data from the sensors will be compared to recent readings and desired levels to check if the values are within range and/or heading out of range. If a parameter is going out of range, it will be automatically adjusted accordingly to bring the values back to acceptable levels.<h5>Experience:</h5><p>This project is difficult because basically everything I'm doing is the first time I'm doing it, but I love the challenge and am grateful for the opportunity to be learning so much in the process. For a complete list, this was my first time working with PHP, Python, Linux, Raspberry Pi, MySQL, database design, software design, sensors and circuitry, and data visualization. I went from never using any of these tools to learning a tremendous amount about these technologies and client/server architecture along the way. Aside from learning all these tools, the hardest part of the project was learning all the best practices and determining the architecture of the software and system.<h5>Hindsight:</h5><p>While this project is still in motion, I'm proud of my ability to take the feature requests from the team and then design and build this software with no prior experience. The feedback from the team is great, there have been no major problems so far. As work continues on automatically correcting parameter values through a feedback loop, I want to learn unit testing to build more stable and robust programs.</div></div></section><br><br><br>
