      <h5>Background:</h5>
        <p>A lot of time when I have to paste something in a document repeatedly, I always question when it's the best time to re-copy what I've already pasted, and then to start pasting that larger segment of repetition in order to finish faster. </p>

      <h5>Goal:</h5>
        <p>Build a game as a simulation to play around with what the fastest combination of copying and pasting is. Use numbers to simulate the process, starting with 1 as the initial paste. Disable both the paste and copy actions a short duration of time after copying to replicate the time it takes to select the current content, right-click, and select the copy option(assumed there's no hot-keys). It's not meant to give me an answer, but it'll be fun to mess around with and compete with my friends to see who can get the highest score. The website should be 100% client side so I can use Github as a host.</p>

      <h5>Design:</h5>
        <p>The tools I used for this are Bootstrap(grid only), jQuery, and the easytimer.js library. For the layout of the game, I used Candy Crush as an inspiration for the overlay screens at the start and end of each game and wanted to implement styling derived from Google's material design. I also really wanted this to behave as a single page app with no reloads, but I didn't want to use a framework in order to challenge myself a bit. All my 'views' are present in index.html and I toggle the views using CSS(this was before I knew this was the wrong way to go about this). All the site's functionality is event driven and uses local storage to save the top 10 high scores. For updating the high scores after a new entry, I used a document fragment to add all the scores at once to save on repaints.</p>

      <h5>Experience:</h5>
        <p>This was my first time using arrays with webstorage. Learned the hard way after almost going mad that local storage only supports strings. I was really proud of my ability to mimic Candy Crush's game flow and keep everything organized and uncluttered. Creating the views and functionality actually wasn't that bad. The hard part was balancing the timing of the animations, fade-ins, fade-outs, hiding, and showing of the different views. I had a fun time writing the logic for the high scores, including learning how to use document fragment and the JSON API, comparing and reordering the scores, and saving the name and scores.</p>

      <h5>Hindsight:</h5>
        <p>I found the way to get a higher score is to paste a lot in the beginning(6-10ish), then after the first copy to start only pasting 2 or 3 times between subsequent copying, and when getting to the last 8 seconds or so to start alternating tapping paste and copy - or course a lot depends on being fast as well. After playing around with it, it doesn't simulate actually copying and pasting as well as I had hoped, but I'm not sure what a better way to do it is.</p>
