      <h5>Background:</h5>
        <p>I wanted a place to showcase my work. It's great to advertise yourself and visit every once in a while to see how far you've come and reminisce all the hard work you've put into your projects.</p>

      <h5>Goal:</h5>
        <p>Create a website to tell the world a little about myself, what my skills are, what I've been up to, and talk about some of the projects I've worked on. It should be simple, inviting, easy to navigate, flow nicely, and reflect a little of my personality. Should be fast and 100% static site so I can use Github as a host.</p>


      <h5>Design:</h5>
        <p>This page was built using only Bootstrap grid. Since I wanted the site to load as fast as possible so I minified all the files and optimized some of the images by adjusting the size and compressing them about 30%. For the layout of the page, I wanted it to tell a story as it's scrolled through so the logical order of events seemed to be to tell a little about myself, what my skills are, what I've built with those skills, and how to contact me. As for the design, I made everything spaced out to declutter the content and to keep focus on only one section at a time and allow for better storytelling. I chose the colors I did because I felt they really brightened up the page and produced a feeling that matched my personality.</p>

      <h5>Experience:</h5>
        <p>When making this site, I liked the thought of using a slider to present my projects. However, since I wanted the site to be fast, it seemed like a waste to use Bootstrap's slider because that would require additional Bootstrap resources to be loaded(since I'm only using Bootstrap grid currently) and I would also need to include jQuery. I could have used plain, vanilla Javascript, but I discovered that a slider can actually be made purely with CSS. While it makes sense, it also blew my mind a little. While I followed a tutorial in setting it up, I learned a lot and it really opened me up to what's possible using just CSS.</p>

      <h5>Hindsight:</h5>
        <p>Too often I look at other people's portfolio site's and they go way overboard and sometimes there's parts that are broken in different browsers because they were trying to do something fancy. I'm happy I found a simple, elegant design to present my work in that wasn't complicated. It's nice to come and look at my old work when I'm chugging through a tough project. It reminds me of how tough some of the other projects were for me at that point in time and how easy it would be to make it now. That gives me motivation to keep pushing forward and excited for what I'll learn next and where my skill level will be another year from now.</p>
