      Financial Independence(FI)
      <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
      <p>Everyone, at some point in their life, wishes they had enough money to be financially independent. To have the freedom to quit their job and work on what they're passionate about while still living comfortably. Now, you're probably reading this because you're just starting your journey on the road to financial independence. Just a few months ago I was in your exact position. I knew I wanted to be self reliant, but I wasn't quite sure where to start. I began scouring the internet for the best ways to become financially independent, reaching dead ends, going in circles, reading redundant or irrelevant articles, but I've learned a lot along the way. Here, in a series of posts, I will attempt to best sum up all the knowledge I have acquired in the hope that it will jump start your journey to FI.

      <blockquote>

        </p>
      </blockquote>


      <h5 id="start">Getting Started</h5>
        <p class="first">Okay, you've made the decision to become financially independent, now what's the first step? The first step is doing something about it, which considering you're here reading this, congratulations! You've already completed the first step! Moving onto step 2: Minimizing expenses.</p>
      <h5 id="expenses">Minimizing Expenses</h5>
        <p class="first">To increase your chances and momentum towards financial independence, start by assessing everywhere your money is going beginning with the largest costs first. For most people this will be your living accommodations. If you're a renter, look into apartments just outside of town as they are likely cheaper than the town center. If you're single and living alone, do you really need a whole apartment to yourself? Having roommates is a great easy way to save a few hundred dollars a month. If you're a homeowner, you're currently paying off a mortgage. This brings us to the next topic: pay off your debts. Whether it's a mortgage, credit card debt, or student loans, paying off loans as fast as possible is important. Take the average home cost of $188k, standard 20% down payment, and 3% interest. After the down payment you will still owe $150k, which equates to roughly $4,500 just in interest for that first year. As you can see this easily puts a dent in your pocket at the end of the day, especially considering this interest isn't part of the equity you're gaining when paying off the principal.
        </p>
        <p>Next you'll want to look into vehicle costs. Leasing is often more expensive than purchasing a used car a few years old. If you own your vehicle, does it often need repairs? Selling it or trading it in to a dealer may be cheaper in the long run if you can afford the upfront costs. How about your car insurance, or any of your insurances for that matter? When was the last time you shopped around for better deals or discounts? Your car insurance may be willing to reevaluate your rate if you haven't had any incidents or if a certain amount of time has passed since your last incident. It's good to do this every 6 months or year to see what kind of promotions or deals are out there. Just be wary that companies may offer lower prices up front and jack them up after a few months so try to get prices locked in on your contract. 
        </p>
        <p>Shopping is another big expense for most. If you're unsure how much you currently spend, start tracking. Try giving yourself a budget as a goal to meet. Look for sales and buy items ahead of when you need them. Meat sales usually lead to big savings if you have enough freezer room to store them. Remove junk food from your list, you already know you shouldn't be having it anyways. Not shopping hungry also helps to avoid non essentials.
        </p>
        <p>You get the point. Everybody's lifestyle and situation is different so only you know what expenses you have and what you can do without. You don't have to remove all niceties from your life, but be aware of what you're spending money on, revisit your expenses every once and awhile, and don't live about your means. 
        </p>

        <p>Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.
          <br><em>- Warren Buffet</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h5 id="earnings">Maximize Earnings</h5>
        <p class="first">Once you've minimized your expenses, the next step is to maximize your earnings. The most reliable way is to get a job that pays more. You can try asking for a raise or promotion at your current workplace, but moving to another company will probably net you a larger pay increase. Depending on the company and your line of work you may also be able to negotiate a company vehicle, meals, and/or phone which will help further decrease your expenses. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyXXLKkEyPQ" target="_blank">Learn more on negotiating salary.</a></strong>
        </p>        

        <p>If your workplace offers 401k matching, you should max out the amount that they will match. It's free money, take advantage of it. If there is no matching then open an IRA account and start contributing early to take advantage of compound interest rates since compounding grows the account exponentially.  If you invest $3k per year at 5% interest for the next 40 years you will make $4.35 million as opposed to only $4.1 million at 39 years and $3.25 million for 35 years.

      </blockquote>

      <h5 id="income">Additional Income</h5>
        <p class="first">Moving on. Now it's time for the key to financial independence: Creating a second source of income. Money on money. Compound money. This step in the process is hard because it's hugely dependent on your skills, lifestyle, risk tolerance, and monetary situation. I will go over a few routes you can take, but your options certainly aren't limited to these. However, no matter which route you take, it's important to note that you should keep your day job until you're fully financially independent. Let's dive into a few possibilities:
        </p>

        <h6 id="technical">Technical</h6>
          <p class="sub">A technical based source of income is great for someone that has an in-demand skill. Your skill could be that you're good at writing, programming, playing an instrument, diet and exercising, or an endless of other possibilities. The goal here is to take your skill and monetize it through freelancing, consulting, or a number of gig services such as <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiverr</a>, <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" target="_blank">Craigslist</a>, <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank">PeoplePerHour</a>, or <a href="http://www.guru.com/" target="_blank">Guru</a>. How do you monetize your skill? Find a niche where there is already a need and focus on that. For example, <a href="https://www.writingrevolt.com/freelance-writing-niches/" target="_blank">if writing is your skill</a> then you can specialize in technical writing for a specific biomedical topic such as CRISPR, content marketing for insurance companies, or screen/stage plays. For diet and exercising you can looking into targeting pre or post-birth mothers, people with Type 1 diabetes if you have it yourself, or maybe writing meal plans for people with certain allergies like gluten.
          </p>

          <p class="sub">To help walk you through the entire process of generating a technical-based side income, I will be writing a more detailed post. Until then, begin thinking of what your stronger skills are and a corresponding niche you can call your own.

          </p>


        <h6 id="stocks">Stocks</h6>
          <p class="sub">Stocks, in my opinion, are the best option. There are various strategies and types of trading styles to appeal to everyone. Since this is a very in-depth topic, I decided not to continue on it here, and instead <a href="https://hanniabu.com/trading.html" target="_self">wrote a dedicated article.</a>
          </p>

        <h6 id="education">Educational</h6>
          <p class="sub">The last route I'll mention is receiving more education. This route isn't for everybody, but neither is trading on the stock markets or productizing yourself. Whether it's getting your first(or second) Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD, receiving further education can help you develop the skills you need to get that high paying job you've always wanted. However, formal education is not the only option available. From paid to free, you can <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">find courses online</a> to learn just about anything. Many colleges and universities offer free courses as well, including Stanford, Duke, John Hopkins, and UPenn. If you're planning to learn online, make sure to research whether online training is viewed as acceptable for this new position you're aiming for. If you settle on the classic brick and mortar education, definitely consider whether the school you register for it worth it. In most cases, if you're not going to be graduating from a top-tier school in your field, then attending a cheaper lower-end school will provide you the best bang for the buck. As long as you're not scraping the bottom of the barrel, the recruiters won't care and you'll save a ton of money.</p>
      
      <p>As stated before, there are many options in this world to make an extra buck. You can pick up a second job, buy a rental property, invest in a private company, stat and ecommerce site, etc. Not everything is ideal so you have to find what works best for you. Working on more than one source of additional income is also a possibility, but make sure not to spread yourself too thin. If you have a few options in mind, but aren't sure which route to take, continue reading to learn how to single one out.

        </p>
      </blockquote>

 
      <h5 id="ev">Assessing Value</h5>
        <p>Naturally, some of you will be torn between a few routes to additional income. So how do you choose which route to follow? The answer is not always an easy one since many personal factors will dictate what's possible for you. To help with the decision process, assessing expected value(EV) will go along way to get you this answer. While a large number of aspects contribute to assessing value, the main determinants can be broken down to return and probability of the return. However, with every possible source of income there will be several potential outcomes with different variances and probabilities of return. To take each outcome into account and arrive at the EV, the following can be used:
        </p>
        
        <p class="eq">EV = (Outcome 1 Return)x(Outcome 1 Probability) + (Outcome 2 Return)x(Outcome 2 Probability) + (Outcome 3 Return)x(Outcome 3 Probability) + ....</p>
        
        <p>Okay, so let's walk through this equation. When assessing each option of income, consider 3 to 5 possible outcomes. At the low end(worst outcome) you may end up losing all your investment and receiving nothing in return. At the high end(best outcome) you may receive a 10x return on your investment. There will be intermediate outcomes as well. The goal here is to come up with a monetary value for each outcome. Then, with each possible outcome, determine the probability(%) of that becoming the reality. You will want to do some research to make an educated guess on what these probabilities are. Lastly, multiply the monetary value of each outcome with the respective probability and add each value together to obtain the EV of this income source.
        </p>

        <p>The resulting EV you arrive at should be a dollar value. Repeat this process with each possible investment and then compare EV's. The investment with the highest EV will be your best bet moving forward with all other personal factors aside. Remember, holding onto your money is an option you should consider as well and may end up having the highest EV.
        </p>


      <h5 id="fi">Achieving FI</h5>
      <p>Financial independence does not come in one night, but the earlier you act sooner it'll arrive. Be patient, keep saving, invest what you can, and it'll come. When you do reach financial independence, don't be so quick to jump ship from your day job. It's a good idea to go an extra year or two for added security. It's often recommended that you use all your available time off at once to take a long vacation and test the waters a bit as most have found that they quickly get bored. If that's the case, keep your job for a bit as busy work until you find a hobby that's stimulating enough to keep and mind and body active. I hope this article has helped jump start your journey and give you some direction. If you would like to be notified when I post more articles on financial independence, subscribe below.
