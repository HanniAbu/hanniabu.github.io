They needed a website to advertise and tell a little about themselves as have another channel of contact for potential customers and press.<h5>Goal:</h5><p>Create a basic, responsive website with information about the company. Should be fast and 100% static site so we could use Github as a host.<h5>Design:</h5><p>Used Bootstrap and jQuery to build the website from the ground up. For the contact form I used Formspree, which is a service that handles the emails and forwards them to you. I chose to use this because it was free and would eliminate the need of a server.<h5>Experience:</h5><p>This was the first website I built from scratch and the first time I used Bootstrap. It took longer than I'd like to admit as I was getting used to all Bootstrap classes and functionality. I also wanted to have a design that reflected the company and the culture, so I spent some time experimenting with different looks.<h5>Hindsight:</h5><p>The scrolling plugin I used is negatively affecting the scrolling experience in Chrome on Mac OS X. I should have optimized the HTML for SEO. I designed this desktop first, mobile second. I really wish I did mobile first. You can see the page takes a second to adjust on mobile. I can probably just rearrange the CSS as a quick fix. These are on my to-do list to fix, but I have more pressing priorities and we might redo the website soon anyways.</div></div></section><br><br><br>
